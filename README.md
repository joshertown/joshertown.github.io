very beta build of this thing i made.
lemme know for any bugs.

future builds will have better file management, better code management, and less buggy material hopefully.

bugs i know of:
-the infografic whenever fullscreen goes off the screen

things to add/remake:
-power button start 'cause it looks garbage
-the animation for the screen coming in that also looks garbage (or just not the vibe i'm looking for)
-more stuff
-settings menu for all your stuff
-an actual site for the web application
-maybe the borders of the screen?
-perhaps the windows design to better fit the asthetic of old time windows
-change design of notepad to a notepad icon on desktop instead of mobile or whatever

why i added so much differences to notepad window:
-looks cool i dunno

anymore questions, remarks, and/or suggestions just ask me.
peace

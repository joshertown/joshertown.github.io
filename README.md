very beta build of this thing i made.
lemme know for any bugs.

future builds will have better file management, better code management, and less buggy material hopefully.

so far, the actual 'thing' is just for showcase at the moment, this took me a pretty long time since this is my first project thingy so i hope you aren't super disappointed. 
cool stuff i think, and the website'll auto update whenever i make updates which is very very sick. lmbao do not mind the 50 updates i did before 'releasing'.

check back here for any updates whenever i feel motivated to, pretty important stuff i think. no info here for now since... yknow, first beta release and all that jazz.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

bugs i know of:

-the infografic whenever fullscreen goes off the screen

-saving on notepad doesn't work for now i dunno why

-pressing the x button on notepad does not remove text & go back to last save

-small 'bug' but the notification icon is a little off the screen

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

things to add/remake:

-power button start 'cause it looks garbage

-the animation for the screen coming in that also looks garbage (or just not the vibe i'm looking for)

-more stuff

-settings menu for all your stuff

-an actual site for the web application

-more applications

-maybe the borders of the screen could use some more stuff

-perhaps the windows design to better fit the asthetic of old time windows

-change design of notepad to a notepad icon on desktop instead of mobile or whatever

-unique cursor option(s) probably

-can i add video effects? is that possible??

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

why i added so much differences to notepad window:

-looks cool i dunno

-everybody has done the same things over and over again so why not spice it up once in a while y'know?

anymore questions, remarks, and/or suggestions just ask me.
peace

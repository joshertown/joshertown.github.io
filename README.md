very beta build of this thing i made.
lemme know for any bugs.

future builds will have better file management, better code management, and less buggy material hopefully.

so far, the actual 'thing' is just for showcase at the moment, this took me a pretty long time since this is my first project thingy so i hope you aren't super disappointed. 
cool stuff i think, and the website'll auto update whenever i make updates which is very very sick. lmbao do not mind the 50 updates i did before 'releasing'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

bugs i know of:

-the infografic whenever fullscreen goes off the screen

-saving on notepad doesn't work for now i dunno why

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

things to add/remake:

-power button start 'cause it looks garbage

-the animation for the screen coming in that also looks garbage (or just not the vibe i'm looking for)

-more stuff

-settings menu for all your stuff

-an actual site for the web application

-maybe the borders of the screen?

-perhaps the windows design to better fit the asthetic of old time windows

-change design of notepad to a notepad icon on desktop instead of mobile or whatever

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

why i added so much differences to notepad window:

-looks cool i dunno

anymore questions, remarks, and/or suggestions just ask me.
peace
